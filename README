I roughly spent around 15 hours on this assignment.
    about 2-3 hours was spent understanding socket programming and leanring how to implement them.
    another couple hours were spent just looking at the code and trying to comprehend the program and to understand what to do. 
    around 1-2 hours with actual programming and the  rest of the time was spent debugging 

From this assignment, I have mainly learnt the fundamentals of socket programming in C.
I have also learned to utilize structs in C as well as gotten a deeper knowledge of how memory allocation using malloc works. 
If I were to start this assignment all over again, I would try to utilize structs much more than I did for this assignment. 
    I only came to realize the usefulness of structs as I was finishing up with the assignment . 
    I felt that my program would be much more structured and easy to understand if I had properly utilized structs. 
Another thing I have leanred is to use version control properly. During this project, i found myself receiving segmentation faults after segmentation faults. 
    A way I was able to navigate those was by using version control and commiting my code incrementally as I went along and going back to my last commit if I got any segmentation faults
    and restarting the work from there. 
Lastly, I've also leared the basics of multithreaded programs using pthreads in C.
